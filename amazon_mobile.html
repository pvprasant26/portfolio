			<b>Choosing the right content on OTT media platforms - Case study</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Unable to choose the right content over OTT platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now etc. is a daily issue for users like me and my friends. This is the reason why I chose this subject for my case study and made an attempt at making modifications to the existing way of options that are displayed in one of these platforms.
			<br/>
			The first step was to understand Why this happens:
			<br/><br/>
			<b>1. Too many options at once</b> 
			<br/><br/>
			A plethora of choices or varieties makes it tough for our brain to choose from it, sometimes ending up choosing nothing at all. Here’s a study demonstrated at Columbia University knows as ‘jam study’.
			<br/><br/>
			<i>In this study, supermarket shoppers were given the option of choosing from a table offering six samples of jam or one displaying 24 varieties.
While more people stopped at the table with 24 choices, only 3 percent went on to purchase a jar, compared to a third of all shoppers who stopped at the table with just six varieties. </i>
			<br/><br/>
			Too many options also causes the next problem which is…
			<br/><br/>
			<b>2. Decision paralysis</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Decision paralysis means a situation in which someone is unable to decide as a result of overanalyzing data or overthinking a problem. 
			<br/><br/>

			<br/><br/>
			When we see an umpteen options on these platforms, and that too without any parameter to compare to each other, it takes a lot of time to make a decision which then leads to decision paralysis which diminishes the user’s satisfaction.
			<br/><br/>
			<b>The research</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Every year, these media services spend millions of dollars on consumer research to build an algorithm to display relevant content to its users. I thought of modifying the algorithm with a small research survey of my own. 
			<br/><br/>
			According to my research, the biggest factor that could influence a user’s choice of selecting a program is friends’ recommendations. I believe that this one big change can impact the decision making positively and engage a user for a longer time.
			<br/><br/>
			It was important to understand the users behavior of:
			<br/><br/>
			<b>1. Source</b> from where they got to know about the content <br/>
			<b>2. Steps</b> before they’re convinced to watch the content
			<br/><br/>
			I created a user set of 15 people who were actively using Prime Video. Even though it’s a very small user set, the responses had a lot of similarities which helped in moving forward with the solution.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<img src="images/amazon/table.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/><br/>
			As per the results, there are 4-5 parameters that a user would like to see before deciding to watch. Hence, I came up with a possible user flow for this solution.
			<br/><br/>
			<img src="images/amazon/flowchart.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/>
			<b>The solution</b>
			<br/><br/>
			
			<div class="solution"></div>
			Current design
			<br/><br/>
			
			<img src="images/amazon/amazon-1.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/><br>
			<img src="images/amazon/amazon-2.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/><br>
			To get recommendations from friends, the user needs to add friends to the Prime account by providing his/her friends’ registered email ID. This helps the platform know that the user has authorized the account to receive recommendations.
			<br/><br/><br>
			<img src="images/amazon/amazon-3.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/><br>
			The first section in the home screen is replaced by the shows that the user had stopped watching earlier. It is a common user behavior that they might want to continue watching a movie/series. 
			<br/><br/>
According to my research, Friends’ recommendations is the most important factor that influences a user for choosing a show and will also passively let the users know what their friends are up to.
			<br/><br/>
Popular movies allows the user to explore something new. They would likely want to explore something new.
			<br/><br/>
If the user is still not able to choose, we can offer him/her genres to explore, which is also one of the important parameters of making the choice.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			<img src="images/amazon/amazon-4.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">
			<br/><br/><br/>
			The pop up now gives the ability to see the friends who recommended this show and also a button to recommend this to any of his/her friends.
			<br/><br/><br/>
			
			<b>Takeaways</b>
			<br/><br/>
			Cognitive load by showing too many choices is not benefiting Prime Video, it is only increasing the overall decision-making time. My study proposed clients like to watch shows prescribed by their Friends 2x more in contrast with the Prime Video proposals. <br/><br/>

As my micro survey was proposing different solutions from the current approach from Prime Video has encouraged me to conduct a bigger survey regarding it, which might not only help Prime Video but all other companies to build better products for its users. <br/><br/>
