    	SeniorWorld.com is India’s largest & fastest growing community of Senior Citizens with 150,000 followers on social media. It is India’s first company established to cater to the overall needs of seniors. SeniorWorld provides products and services specially designed for seniors such as Travel, Electronics, Health Care and, Hobby classes contributing to the society.<br/><br/>

        I worked with the company for over an year with an aim to support the vision of the co-founders. Keeping in mind that the users of the website are not only senior citizens but also their children (who might help them in availing these services), the design had to be very lucid and yet look content-rich. With this as the starting point, I had chosen the theme colors as red and blue since they are medically tested to be the most favourable colors for seniors and contrast was important to aid in depth perception.<br/><br/>
